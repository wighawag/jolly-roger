## Svelte conventions

- **`.svelte` files must be logic-less or logic-minimal.** They should only
  render UI and wire props/stores together. Small presentational conveniences
  are fine (a display formatter, a class toggle, a UI-only animation, local
  open/closed modal state). Anything else, business/domain logic, async
  blockchain calls, transaction building, balance checks, data
  fetching/derivation, non-trivial computation, filtering/sorting/aggregating
  domain data, network error handling, belongs in a plain `.ts` module (a
  helper, a store, or a service) that the component imports.

- **Never create `.svelte.ts` files.** Do not use Svelte runes
  (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, ...) outside of `.svelte` components. Put
  reusable logic in plain `.ts` files and expose reactivity with Svelte stores
  (`writable`/`readable`/`derived` from `svelte/store`). Components consume
  those stores with the `$store` syntax and own any `$effect`/lifecycle wiring
  themselves.

- Logic lives in `.ts`, reactivity crosses the boundary as stores. Prefer
  factory functions that return `{subscribe, ...actions}` (see the existing
  stores under `src/lib/**` and `src/routes/**/lib/stores/`).

## The framework boundary

- **Only `web/src/lib/kit` may import `$app/*`.** Everything under `web/src/lib/core` takes what it needs from the framework as a parameter (`PathResolver`, `ServiceWorkerEnvironment`), and `web/src/routes/**` is exempt because routes are the framework's own surface. `web/test/framework-boundary.test.ts` enforces this and `web/src/lib/kit/README.md` states the scope, including what the rule deliberately does not cover.

- **`web/src/lib/index.ts` is where the app is composed**, which is why it may import both `./kit/*` and the environment. Anything that composes THIS app belongs there rather than in `core/`.

- The two boundary tests and this section are INHERITED from `template-svelte`, the root of this template tree, where they are also enforced. A change to either that is meaningful for a sibling belongs there rather than here, or every sibling silently misses it.
